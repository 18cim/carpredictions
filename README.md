# CISC372 Final Report: Used Car Price Predictions

These are the files for my final project. 
I have included...
  1. ipynb file of my code (CarPrice.ipynb)
  2. ppt file of my presentation with voiceover (CISC372PRES.ppt)
  3. pdf of my report (372REPORT.pdf)
  4. zip file of dataset (cardata.zip)
  5. csv file of the three prediction cars


The link to the dataset can be found below, however I had to change somethings because it wouldn't properly open on my computer, so please instead see the zip file I've added to the repository.
